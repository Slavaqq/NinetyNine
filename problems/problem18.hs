-- Extract a slice from a list.
-- Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.

slice :: [a] -> Int -> Int -> [a]
slice xs start end = take (end - start + 1) $ drop (start - 1) xs
